* Time Machine Adventure
The /Time Machine Adventure/ is an educational game in which the player pilots a time machine into the distant past. Along the way, the time-traveller will visit important events in the history of the species, the planet, & the cosmos.
* How to use 
The app is very bare-bones at the moment, all I've implemented are
- a display to show the year
- a slider to control the time machine's speed

To preview the game, download the folder to your computer. Unzip if necessary, then open the folder and open =index.html=--you may need to right click the file to open it with the right program.
Currently tested on the latest versions of Chrome, Firefox & Safari.
